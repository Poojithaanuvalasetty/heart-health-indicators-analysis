Exploring BRFSS survey data to identify predictors of heart disease using regression and EDA

# ❤️ Heart Health Indicators Analysis

This project explores public health survey data from the BRFSS (Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System) to identify key risk factors for heart disease using logistic regression, exploratory data analysis, and data visualization.

---

## 🎯 Objective

- Analyze how health conditions (e.g., diabetes, COPD, kidney disease) and lifestyle choices (e.g., smoking, physical activity) contribute to the risk of heart disease.
- Model relationships using logistic regression in R and visualize trends in Python.
- Identify patterns across age, gender, race/ethnicity, and geography.

## 🧠 Dataset

- **Source:** [CDC BRFSS Survey Data – 2022](https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/annualdata/annual2022.html)
- **Size:** 445,000+ responses | 40+ health/lifestyle features

## 🛠️ Tools & Techniques

- Python: Data cleaning, correlation matrix, and bar plots  
- R: Logistic regression modeling for stroke, angina, and heart attack  
- AWS S3: Dataset hosting  
- MySQL (AWS RDS): Structured querying for health factor exploration

## 📊 Key Findings

- Heart disease is most common in men aged 65+, especially among white non-Hispanic individuals.
- Comorbidities such as diabetes, COPD, kidney disease significantly increase the risk of heart attack and stroke.
- Daily smoking combined with alcohol usage showed the strongest link to heart health risk.
- States with highest heart disease incidence: Mississippi, West Virginia, Arkansas  
- States with lowest: Hawaii, Colorado, Utah

## 📈 Visualizations

- Correlation matrix of health factors  
- Boxplots of age groups vs. risk levels  
- Bar charts of TotalHeartDiseases by race, gender, and region
